# Paper Artifact Map

Experiments are selected explicitly, not by timestamps or loose filename searches.

The unified aggregate reference is
`paper_reproduction/reference/aggregate_winrate_bootstrap_cis.csv`. The runner
recomputes it from pair outcomes, not from figure annotations.

## Retained, Not Main-Paper Inputs

- Amount results, early moral high-low studies, unframed `user_prompt_role`
  experiments, system-prompt studies, and old `highlow_intervention` runs are
  retained history. Do not substitute them for the explicitly selected inputs.
- Mid-effort appendix artifacts remain in `results/appendix_effort_dose_*`.
  The four-step runner does not currently rebuild that historical experiment
  from its original votes.
- Source utility fits/outcome tables are in `data/inputs/` and the specifications.
  Re-estimating utilities requires model calls and the cited Utility Engineering
  pipeline; it is not part of offline statistical reproduction.
- Frontier-model, religion-beneficiary, and next-task follow-ups are separate
  explorations, not the seven-model paper roster. Private preservation does not
  imply public publication.

## Definitions

- `CURRENT_PAPER/docs/canonical_prompt_book.md`: approved actor paradigm.
- `CURRENT_PAPER/docs/judge_prompts.md`: literal judging prompts.
- `analysis_specs/feature_definitions.yaml`: editable feature definitions.
- `analysis_specs/reasoning_trace_stance_classifier.md`: recovered coding instructions.
- `data/processed/provenance.json`: processed-input lineage.

`outputs/paper_ready/` is not another canonical location. Regenerated outputs
belong in `outputs/reproduced/`; accepted snapshots belong in `CURRENT_PAPER/`.
